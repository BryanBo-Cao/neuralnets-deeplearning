## Environment:
python 2.7.10
I installed TensorFlow by virtualenv: tensorflow-0.12.1
TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup#virtualenv_installation

## ToRun:
```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow
```
Run the ```.ipynb``` files under the ```assignment3-BoCao/src/jupyter``` directory.

Open a terminal, activate Virtualenv environment by:
```
source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate
```
deactivate Virtualenv environment by
```
deactivate
```

Terminal Example:
```
➜  Repositories
➜  Repositories source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate
(tensorflow) ➜  Repositories deactivate
➜  Repositories
```

Cd to "assignment*" directory, run ```python part*.py``` directly.

For instance, if you want to run ```part1.py``` code, type ```python part1.py```.

3 parts solutions are ```part1.py```, ```part2.py``` and ```part3.py``` respectively, I've put a lot of efforts in this assignment, each part's code was written from scratch.
